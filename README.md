# app demo


# notes for readability
- i mainly use xcode's local git source control hence crazy commit history sorry
- started adding firebase but decided not to as of rn
- future plans:
    - add sketchfab download api (https://sketchfab.com/developers/download-api) to access library of .usdz models and populate model picker view
    - add image to text recognition so users can point their camera at specific lines of text without copying/pasting from the site


# how to run
- have XCode at least version 13
- have iPhone X or later
- have usbâ€”usb-c cord 
- clone the repo
- plug in and build 

*might add backend  later but firebase is currently not implememented. don't do the below steps if not using firebase!*
- go to the project directory
- (if firebase used) run the following command to create podfile
```bash
pod init
```
- open the podfile
```bash
open podfile
```
- copy and paste this to the podfile
```
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '14.0'

target 'advocAR' do
  # Comment the next line if you don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks! :linkage => :static
